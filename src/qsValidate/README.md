# Command Line Quadratic Equation Solver

Solve a quadratic equation in standard form (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) by entering values
for a, b, and c. The calculator will give answers for x1 and x2 and indicate whether
there are real roots. This project is done to prepare for the final Senior Project
for Western Michigan Universities Computer Science program. Two students practice
the extreme programming agile methodology.
